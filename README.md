# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems. Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

The solutions are implemented in two languages: Python and TypeScript.

## Structure

Each problem will have its own directory, named after the problem number (e.g., `00000`, `00001`). Inside each directory, you will find:

- `problem.md`: A markdown file containing the problem description.
- `XXXXX.py`: The Python solution for problem XXXXX.
- `index.ts`: The TypeScript solution for problem XXXXX.
- `image.png` (optional): Any relevant images for the problem.

## Languages Used

- **Python**: For concise and often quick implementations, especially for mathematical problems.
- **TypeScript**: For solutions where type safety and a more structured approach are beneficial, or simply for practice.

Run Typescript files with `npx ts-node index.ts`
